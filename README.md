# PostgreSQL installer

**This project is a bash script that aims to setup [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) on Linux, as easily as possible!**
Inspired by the simplicity of another installation script made by [angristan](https://github.com/angristan) for WireGuard.
## Usage

Download and execute the script. Answer the questions asked by the script and it will take care of the rest.
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nitlix/postgres-install/master/postgres-install.sh
chmod +x postgres-install.sh
./postgres-install.sh
```

It will install PostgreSQL, enable global listening and enable it on startup.
Run the script again to list, add or remove databases!
